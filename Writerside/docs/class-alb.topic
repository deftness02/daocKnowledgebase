    The Britons are the human inhabitants of Albion, the kingdom that Arthur founded and kept intact for his reign. Now, however, it is starting to decline - especially in the border areas, where constant incursion by enemy raiding parties is becoming common. The Britons are comprised of the common Briton, the tall intelligent Avalonian, the brawny Highlander, the dexterous Saracen, the slimy Inconnu, and the lumbering Half Ogres

    Briton magic comes from the study of the arts of elemental magic - the essence of all that is around us. The center of this study is the city of Avalon, which boasts the strongest and most powerful mage guilds.

    The Highlanders were driven from their territories north of Camelot by the incessant warfare with the other Realms. They are larger than the other Britons, usually are strong and hardy.

    The Inconnu are the mysterious servants of Lord Arawn, and have allied with Albion to help retake the lost Island of Avalon, which has been overrun by the forces of Morgana. Not all of Albionâ€™s human inhabitants have accepted the Inconnu, and human suspicions make their alliance an uneasy one.

    The Avalonians are from the mystical city of Avalon, which is the seat of magical study in Albion. Hence, they are of a more magical bent than the other Briton inhabitants.

    The Saracens are the descendents of Sir Palomides, the dusky Knight from the far southern deserts whose descendents remained in Albion to help further Arthur's crusade. They are generally quicker and more dexterous than their Briton counterparts.

    The Half Ogres are the descendents of the Ogres of Krondon and bored Avalonian border guards from Caer Diogel. They combine the heartiness and strength of the ogres with some of the magical prowess of the Avalonians.

    Official DAoC Descriptions of the Races of Albion:

    Avalonian:
    A taller, thinner, more austere and intelligent human, hailing from the magical city of Avalon. More adept at magic than the other Briton races.

    Briton:
    The standard human of Albion, good at many things, able to be of many classes -- the quintessential jack of all trades.

    Half Ogre:
    Due to some misunderstandings that occurred at the time of the Drakoran invasion, the Thrawn Ogres of Krondon consider themselves enemies of Albion. However, they were once allies, and at that time there was some interbreeding between Avalonions and Ogres, resulting in a new breed, now referred to as Half Ogres. These Half Ogres have inherited the brute strength of their Ogre ancestors and the intelligence and curiosity of the Avalonians. They may not react as quickly as the typical Avalonian, and some consider them dimwitted as a result. With very high strength and above average constitution and intelligence, Half Ogres are natural tanks, in many ways similar to trolls in Midgard, but can also make average spellcasters. Their dexterity and quickness statistics, however, are very low.

    Highlander:
    Large kilt-wearing men and women from the northern Highlands of Albion. Highlanders are big, strong, and exceedingly loyal subjects. They are especially good at armed combat.

    Inconnu:
    The Inconnu (literally "mysterious") are small pale humanoids - white-ish skin, pale hair and extremely large dark eyes. They live underground, and exist to serve Arawn, the "old world" Lord of the Underworld.

    Saracen:
    Hailing from the desert sands far to the south, the Saracen is the descent of Sir Palomides, one of Arthur's most devoted knights. Saracens excel in anything that involves dexterity and quickness.
